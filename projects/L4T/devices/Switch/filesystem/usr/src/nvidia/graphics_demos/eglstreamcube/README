An example illustrating EGL stream rendering by rendering an arbitrary
nvgldemo app to a texture and then applying that texture to the faces of
a spinning cube.

Here, gears and ctree are the EGLStream producers and eglstreamcube is the
EGLStream consumer and can use the incoming frames as textures to draw
a face of the cube.

./eglstreamcube -socket /tmp/test &
./gears -eglstreamsocket /tmp/test -1 &
./ctree -eglstreamsocket /tmp/test &
